# Crash-cases-Road-Condition-Anaysis
This set of raw data contains crash reports from Monroe County in 2020. This data originates from the “Automated Report and Information Exchange System” (ARIES) of the Indiana State Police. This system contains crash data organized by collisions, units (vehicles), and individuals.

As with any database, the validity of conclusions resulting from the data is contingent upon accurate and complete data entry. Lack of information from hit-and-run collisions, confusion surrounding alternate names of roads (e.g., Country Club Drive, Winslow Road), misspelled or mis-entered street names, GPS errors, and incomplete data entry undoubtedly introduce some error into the results of this report. Therefore, results should not be interpreted rigidly.
